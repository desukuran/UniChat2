<h3>Why register COM components?</h3>

The registry is a system database that holds configuration information.
The registry provides necessary bindings between identifiers for COM
components and the implementation for that component. COM components 
need to be in the registry to be created.
<p>

Typically, a vendor registers COM components as part of the
installation process. For this sample, there is no installation
program, therefore, you must register the COM component yourself.

<h3>Using RegSvr32</h3>

REGSVR32.EXE is a tool that registers server DLL files. The DLL
must include self-registration information. All ActiveX<sup>&trade;</sup> controls 
and many other COM components (in-process servers) are 
self-registering.
<p>

To run RegSvr32:

<ul>
<li>In Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> 95, RegSvr32 is located in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Windows 
    installation directory. Typically, this directory is <i>not</i>
	on the PATH. To run RegSvr32, in a command window type:
	<pre>     %windir%\system\regsvr32 <i>serverfile</i></pre>
<li>In Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> NT<sup>&reg;</sup>, RegSvr32 is located in the SYSTEM32 subdirectory of the Windows 
    installation directory. Typically, this directory <i>is</i> on
	the PATH. To run RegSvr32, in a command window type:
	<pre>     regsvr32 <i>serverfile</i></pre>
</ul>

To register the COM component:

<ol>
<li>Create a command window.<br>
    From the Start menu, select Programs.<br>
	Select <b>MS-DOS Prompt</b> or <b>Command Prompt</b>, depending
	on the version of the operating system.
<li>In the command window, run RegSvr32.<br>
 See the directions listed
    earlier, substituting <b>beeper.dll</b> for <i>servername</i>.
</ol>

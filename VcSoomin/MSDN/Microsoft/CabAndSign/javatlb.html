<h3>What is the Java Type Library Wizard?</h3>
<p>

The Java Type Library Wizard is a tool that reads type libraries from 
.TLB, .OLB, .OCX, .DLL, and .EXE files and creates Java class 
files with information about the COM interfaces and methods.  
These class files are needed for both compiling and running 
a Java project using COM components.

<h3>Using the Java Type Library Wizard</h3>
<p>

To create a Java description of COM components:
<ol>
<li>From the Tools menu in Developer Studio, choose Java Type Library Wizard.<br>
    The Java Type Library Wizard dialog box appears.
<li>From the list, select the COM component(s) you want, check the
    box to the left of the name.<br>
	For this sample, select <b>Beeper 1.0 Type Library</b>.
<li>Click OK.<br>
    The Java Type Library Wizard processes the selected type libraries
	and creates Java descriptions of the selected COM components.
</ol>

<h3>Output from the Java Type Library Wizard</h3>

After you have created Java descriptions of COM components, the 
output window shows two useful types of information, the <b> import</b> statement and the SUMMARY.TXT notice.

<h4><b>import</b> statement</h4>
<p>

After the Java Type Library Wizard is finished, the output window 
displays a Java <b>import</b> statement. In this sample:
<pre>   import beeper.*;</pre>
<p>

Typically, you copy this line of text and insert it
into the beginning of any Java source file that
uses the COM component. This has been done for you in this
sample; see line 22 in <b>javabeep.java</b> .
<p>

<h4>The <b>summary.txt</b> line</h4>
<p>

Following the <b>import</b> statement, the output window has 
lines saying that the file SUMMARY.TXT has been created.
This file lists the interfaces and classes in the Java
description of the type library. Use this file to check the
types for the parameters and return values in the methods.
<p>

You will note that there are no methods listed for any of
the classes. Recall when calling COM from Java, you will 
use the <b>class</b> file to create the COM component, but
you must use the <b>interface</b> file to access the COM
component.
<p>

Double-click the SUMMARY.TXT line to view that file in 
Developer Studio.

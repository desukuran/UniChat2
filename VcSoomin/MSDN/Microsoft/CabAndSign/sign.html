<h2>Signing a Program File</h2>

Once you have a test cerficate, it is easy 
to sign your CAB file. For information on
creating a CAB file, see <a href=cab.html>Making
Cabinets</a>. For information on creating a
test certificate, see <a href=cert.html>Creating
a Test Certificate</a>. For general information,
see the <a href=readme.html>readme</a>.
<p>

To sign a program file using the Code Signing Wizard:

<ol>
<li>Run SIGNCODE.
<pre>   C:\SIGN\SIGNCODE
</pre>
This assumes that you installed the Code Signing
Kit in the C:\SIGN directory. If you have not installed 
the Code Signing Kit, you can find it on the CD-ROM in 
the \CAB&SIGN directory.<br>
The Code Signing Wizard dialog box appears.
<li>Click Next to advance to the next page.
<li>In the first edit box, enter the name of the 
    program file you want to sign.<br>
    For this example, use FIRSTCAB.CAB. Use the 
	Browse button to help you find this file.
<li>In the second edit box, enter a name for this
    program file. This name will appear on the 
	certificate.
<li>Click Next to advance to the next page.
<li>In the first edit box, enter the name of the
    SPC file. <br>
	You created this file. For this example use
	CERT.SPC. For information on creating a
	test Software Publishing Certificate, see 
	<a href=cert.html>Creating a Test Certificate</a>. <br>
	Use the Browse button to help you find this file.
<li>In the second edit box, enter the name of the
    PVK file. <br>
	You created this file. For this example use
	MYKEY.PVK. For information on creating a
	private key file, see <a href=cert.html>Creating
	a Test Certificate</a>. <br>
	Use the Browse button to help you find this file.

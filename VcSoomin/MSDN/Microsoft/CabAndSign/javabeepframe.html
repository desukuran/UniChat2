This class is used to run <b>javabeep.class </b>
as a standalone application.  
<p>

When run as an application, the class file must already be on
your machine. When run as an applet, the class file may be downloaded
to your machine. There is a potential security threat running
downloaded software. To run a Java<sup>&trade;</sup> applet that uses COM components,
the applet code must be trusted. See the <a href=readme.html>readme</a>
for more information on trusted class files.
<p>

Open <a href=javabeep.html>javabeep.html</a> to view the applet.

<h3>Creating a CAB file using a DDF file</h3>

This sample includes a .DDF file, FIRSTCAB.DDF. A DDF file describes the layout of the .CAB file that will be created.
<p><h4>To create the CAB file:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the project directory, run the following command:
</ul>
<pre>      <b>C:\CABDIR\DIAMOND /F FIRSTCAB.DDF</b></pre>
This assumes you installed the Cabinet Development Kit in 
<b>C:\CABDIR</b>.
<p>
If you have not installed the Cabinet Development Kit, you can 
find it on the CD in the <b>\CAB&SIGN</b> directory.

<H3>Creating your own DDF file</H3>

To put together your own cab file, you need to create a 
DDF file. The DDF file is a text file that tells DIAMOND 
exactly how you want the CAB file to be laid out.  DDF files 
can be quite complex, especially if they describe the layout of
CAB files used for software installation. Fortunately, CAB files 
for distributing components over the Internet are far simpler than those
used for installation programs. 
<P>

Create a .DDF file with the following 
lines in it:

<pre>    .OPTION EXPLICIT 
    .Set CabinetNameTemplate=<i>CABNAME</i>.cab
    .Set DiskDirectoryTemplate=
    .Set Cabinet=on
    .Set Compress=on
    .Set ReservePerCabinetSize=6144
    <i>CLASSNAME</i>.class
    <i>CLASSNAME</i>.class
</pre>

where <i>CABNAME</i> is the name of the CAB file to be created (in 
this case, <b>FIRSTCAB.CAB</b>), and <i>CLASSNAME</i> entries form 
a list of the files to include in the CAB file (in this case, 
<b>javabeep.class</b>).
<p>

Save this file in the project directory. Give it some descriptive 
name. It will simplify maintenance if the name of the DDF file is 
the same as the name of the CAB file it describes. Use the file 
extension <b>.DDF</b>. 
<p>

As you add classes to this project, add them to the list at
the bottom of the DDF file.
<p>

As you see, working with CAB files is quite simple once you get 
used to creating them. In fact, they are very convenient. A CAB 
will download faster than the individual files because the files 
in the CAB are in a compressed format. Also, multiple class files
can be packaged together into a single CAB file. This also 
increases efficiency, since packaging multiple class files for
an applet as a single CAB file decreases the number of 
network-access operations needed to download the applet.

<h3>What is a Certificate?</h3>
<P>

Before you can sign a program file you need to create a 
company certificate. The company certificate usually 
includes general information about the company, such has 
contact information. For the purpose of this sample, 
you are just testing, not publishing. So, you will 
make a very simple test certificate file.
<p>

To get a valid Software Publisher Certificate (SPC), you will
need to contact a certification autority.

<h3>Making the Test Certificate</h3>

To create a test certificate, type the following 
commands in a command window:
<pre>   C:\SIGN\MAKECERT -u:<i>MyKey</i> -n:CN=<i>MySoftwareCompany</i> -k:MYKEY.PVK CERT.CER
   C:\SIGN\CERT2SPC C:\SIGN\ROOT.CER CERT.CER CERT.SPC
</pre>

<b>Note</b>: The MAKECERT tool is sensitive to the case of 
the flags. You must use lowercase <b>-u</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-k</b>. 
The value for the <b>-n</b> flag uses uppercase <b>CN=</b>.
<p>
 
These command assume that you installed the Code Signing
Kit in the C:\SIGN directory. If you have not installed 
the Code Signing Kit, you can find it on the CD-ROM in 
the \CAB&SIGN directory.
<p>

The first command, MAKECERT, creates a test certificate 
file CERT.CER and an associated private key file 
MYKEY.PVK. You can replace the <i>MyKey</i> and 
<i>MySoftwareCompany</i> with values of your own choosing. 
The private key file MYKEY.PVK holds the <i>MyKey</i> value for 
this certificate. You can change the name of the test
certificate file or the private key file. If you do, 
you will need to change the parameters to later commands 
to use your filenames.
<p>

The second command, CERT2SPC, creates a Software Publisher 
Certificate (SPC) from the test certificate file CERT.CER. 
It uses ROOT.CER for information on the test certification 
authority. It creates the SPC file CERT.SPC.
<p>

You use the private key file MYKEY.PVK and the SPC file
CERT.SPC to sign program files. For information on signing
program files, see <a href=sign.html>Signing a Program File</a>.
<p>

The PVK and SPC files can be used over and over. Creating
them in a separate directory facilitates their reuse.
In a non-test case, you must guard these two files, since
they will digitally sign any program file as coming from 
you.
